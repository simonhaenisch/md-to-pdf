# Overview
- Groups 2-4 people
- Submission:
	- 4 page report
	- Final oral presentation
- Sample project: https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/project.html
- 1-3 Best project awards will be given

- Shared project from other classes is allowed
	- requires bigger/better project
	- declare what class shared with
- External collaborators allowed (outside of CS4650 class)

## Basic Requirements
- Use LaTeX template from ACL
	- Abstract, Prior work, model, model, data, ....
- Include references
- statement of contributions from each group members' contribution
- Writeup quality is important to your grade
- **3 to 8 minute oral presentation** as the final exam

# Proposal
- Not required
- 2 pages total
- 1 page summary of relevant key research for topic
	- Bibliographical info
	- Background (motivation, related work, why important?)
	- Contributions: new algos, new experimental results/analysis, new meta-analysis of old papers, new datasets, etc.
	- Limitations and discussion
	- Why this paper? What is the wider research context?
- 1 page summary of outline
	- Main goal and motivation
	- What NLP tasks involved?
	- What data?
	- What methods?
	- What baseline?
	- How will results be evaluated?
		- Find similar eval methods for similar topics (sentence classification, sentiment, etc. If using a novel dataset then make reasoning)

# General Tips
- What are your novel contributions?
- What flaws or details in result?
- Have an overall sensible idea
More from this slide cut out for time

# Finding a Topic
Two starting points:
1. Nails: Start with a domain
2. Hammers: ...

"If you see a research area where many people are working, go somewhere else"
"Skate to where the puck is going, not where it has been"

# Typical Project Types
1. Find an application/task of interest, explore how to approach and solve effectively with an existing model
2. Analyze the behavior of models or existing datasets
	- How the model represents linguistic knowledge or what kinds of phenomena it can handle or errors that it makes
	- ...
3. Create a new dataset, conduct some analysis, train a model
	- For existing task but better way to create better dataset?
	- May involve manual annotation
	- Conduct quantitive and linguistic analysis
4. Implement a complex neural arch and demonstrate its performance
5. Come up with new or variant neural network model and explore its empirical success (much harder since 2020)
