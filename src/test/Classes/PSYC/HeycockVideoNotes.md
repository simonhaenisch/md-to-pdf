# Prescriptive & Descriptive Rules
**Syntactic Theory**: The kinds of rules for how words are assembled to create larger units of meaning.

What do people know when they know a language's syntax?
- What rules they should follow to produce "*good*" sentences.

Grammar rules are abstractly similar to the concept of laws.
Laws of a country vs laws of nature. 

We can't provide a set of valid sentences, so speakers must subconsciously infer all the descriptive rules for their language.

## Prescriptive Rules
Learned fixed rules. Similar to the explicitly defined legal laws of a country. These rules are codified by institutions.
These rules can be disrespected and ignored while still producing understandable phrases.
Still a reasonable metric of how language is used broadly.

Prescriptive norms are largely a result of more ancient forms of a language and are enforced in an attempt of preservation. 

**Examples:**
- Don't split infinitives: "He decided quickly *to leave* the room" instead of "He decided *to* quickly *leave* the room"
	- This is a prescriptive rule.
- Don't end sentences with prepositions
- Don't do "me and Bob", do "Bob and I"

## Descriptive Rules
Observations of linguistic behavior for a group of people.

Can be collected by inspecting corpora of written language.

Observing what speakers **do** is important, but also what they **don't do** is important.

Speakers are able to judge if a string of words is grammatically correct or not without pointing to specific prescriptive rules to explain their conclusion. This judgement can be used to determine what speakers **don't do**.

Asterisks are used to label sentences which are syntactically invalid (either prescriptively or descriptively).
Ex. \* "Which book did Anna read and a newspaper?"

### Descriptive Example
**Valid Transformation Example:**
Original phrase:
```
Barbara said that she saw Carlo yesterday.
```
Transformed as a question:
```
Who did Barbara say she saw yesterday?
```

**Invalid Transformation Example:**
Original phrase:
```
Barbara said that Carlo saw her yesterday.
```
Transformed as a question (in a similar manner to the example above):
```
* Who did Barbara say that saw her yesterday?
```
This question should in theory be syntactically valid, but just doesn't ***feel*** valid to most English speakers (but not according to any specific rule that English speakers are taught).

The role of linguists here is to define this observed rule.

# Constituency
Sentences are not just strings of words. They have internal structure built from subgroups (constituents) which can have nested layers.

The acquisition of language by children is built on this understanding of internal structure of constituency.

The rules for forming a question from a sentence are based on the structure of the sentence, not a reordering of the sequence of words.
Move the first auxiliary phrase after the subject constituent phrase. ("\[The girl\] **is** tall")

Ex: `The girl is tall.`  becomes `Is the girl tall?`

**Complex example:**
Original sentence: "\[The boy that is holding the plate\] **can** see the girl."

If we were to just move the the first aux to the front would become:
"**Is** the boy that holding... ",

but should be:
"**Can** the boy that is holding the plate see the girl?"

## Recursive structure
Can have nested constituents:
"\[\[\[Tall\] boys\] \[\[hold\] \[the plates\]\]\]"

"The girl read the book" built from:
- "The girl"
- "the book"
- "read the book"
But **DOES NOT** have a constituent "The girl read"
