# Intro
Nativist vs Empiricist debate. It's both!

What innate knowledge might look like and how it contributes to acquisition.

There are some things that human brains *are just good at*. And those help in the process of language acquisition. 

Psychology in general has reframed lots of problems in the frame of statistical learning problems.

# The debate
Any ability that we have as a species is on the spectrum from:
- **Empiricism:** All knowledge and reason come from some experience and learning from that
- ... (everything in between)
- **Nativism:** Mind has some pre-existing structure it leverages to interpret experience

# Positive & Negative Evidence
**Positive:** Children are exposed to people forming & reacting to grammatical sentences and NOT responding to ungrammatical sentences

**Negative:** Feedback on one's own usage and grammaticality

# Early Environment
For children:
- Estimated 5k-7k utterances a day
- Between $\frac{1}{4}$ and $\frac{1}{3}$ of these utterances are questions
- Over 20% are not "full" adult sentences (Noun or prepositional phrases)
- Only 15% have typical English SVO form
- ~45% of all maternal utterances began with one of 17 words ("what", "that", "it", "you", etc.)

In summary, linguistic environment for children is *just not very complicated*.

## Feedback in Environment
Kids generally don't want to receive correction on their grammar. (child confiding in an adult, only for them to correct their grammar, feelsbadman...)

Still get "implicit" negative feedback. Talking so ungrammatically that it makes it difficult for your company to understand you motivates you to speak grammatically. 

Turns out (from "Adam" case study by Brown & Hanlon (1970)) that adults understand children's utterances regardless of their grammatical correctness.

Somehow kids are able to learn pretty well without making what would seem like the required number of errors to fully learn the whole feature-space. 
Thus Pinker, Marcus **conclude that some understanding must just be innate.**

# Chomsky's poverty of the stimulus
Children aren't exposed to enough data to zero in on all the language rules that they follow in the time frame that they appear to learn them

Something must be guiding/constraining the search space
Parameters setting and "Universal Grammar"

# On innate knowledge
Innate knowledge is not the accumulation of facts or rules.

It's just kinda *known* already.

# Current view: Mixed process
Children have surprisingly powerful techniques for learning patterns.

Some things just don't seem sufficiently taught just by environment, there are clearly some constraints at work.

**"Sensitive periods"** seem to be real.

# Learning periods: Sensitive vs Critical
## Critical
"Critical period" is reserved for this period of time where if there is no stimulus then there will be resulting impairment of peak proficiency.

This is shown for the visual cortex by sewing kitten's eyes shut.
If sewn shut in the first 2.5 weeks then vision just won't be the same.
If between the 12th and 40th weeks, then kitten will recover with normal vision. 

Early stimulus results in changes in neural structure and more/deeper connections.

## Sensitive
Genie case study.

Locked in room until 12 years old, not allowed to be spoken to.
By 17 had vocabulary of average 5 year old, not an indicated functional understanding of syntax.

Stopped talking around age 30.

Similar results for deaf children born to hearing parents who don't know sign language.
