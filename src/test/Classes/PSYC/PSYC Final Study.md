# Short Answer Qs
1.  **When we refer to language users as being sensitive to ‚Äústatistical‚Äù properties of language, what do we mean?**

Many sounds are in a continuous space and while learning a new language speakers will learn the separations between the different sounds (easy for consonants, harder for vowels). Baby's are more sensitive to phoneme variety than adults that are familiar with a language because they are conditioned to certain distributions of variety for each distinct phoneme. This is why children are faster at acquiring new languages, they are more sensitive to phonetic variety and similarly sensitive to grammatical structure variety. 

"Nudged" towards correct label for distinct sounds in a language.
Division between words are where neighboring phonemes have a low probability of occurring in real words.

Neural architectures are better at dealing with soft constraints.

2.  **Give an example of such sensitivity to statistical information in language taken from any point in the semester. Imagine you are giving a short 4 or 5 sentence explanation to an intelligent acquaintance who does not have a background in psycholinguistics.**

Baby distinct phonemes #TODO: find the example from lecture



3.  **I have said multiple times during the semester (maybe too many times) that modular theories are often excellent places for research to start because these theories make predictions using words like ‚Äúalways‚Äù and ‚Äúnever‚Äù. What are properties of modules in these theories and what is it about modules that allows such strong predictions (even if these predictions are often inconsistent with the data)?**

Modules are dedicated brain structures for achieving specific tasks. Such as phonological or lexical processing, or syntax parsing, etc. Testing these modules simply require testing the task that could theoretically be managed by a specific brain structure and can thus be done with a very specific and measurable task.

4.  **When we are presented with a sequence of words forming a sentence, the evidence is that we immediately attempt to identify the syntactic relations between words and we do not wait until the end of the sentence to do so. So take the following sentence: ‚ÄúJohn saw the man on the mountain with the telescope.‚Äù¬† When we encounter ‚Äúwith the telescope‚Äù what is the goal of a modular syntactic parser when it selects one of two possible ways that this prepositional phrase can be attached to other constituents in the sentence?**¬†¬†

The goal of the parser is to make the fastest loosely sensible interpretation.
The phrase would most likely first be attached to "the man" and then later potentially reconsidered to be attached to "John".

5.  **NLP models of semantics use a large corpus of text to create semantic representations for words, eventually a many dimension vector for each word in the vocabulary. These vectors essentially map semantic relatedness onto a multidimensional space where distance is inversely related to relatedness (closer is more related). I have two questions.¬† First, what is the information that these models are extracting from the text corpus?¬† Second, how does one train a neural network model to extract this information? (Hint: these models are often referred to as ‚Äúpredict‚Äù models.¬† What are they predicting?).**  

Just about co-occurrence. 

**Sentence for the following questions 6 and 7

**A. The witness examined by the lawyer was unreliable.**

**B. The evidence examined by the lawyer was unreliable.**

6.  **A strictly modular theory of syntactic parsing predicts that readers will incorrectly parse both of these sentences. Specifically, readers will pause at ‚Äòby the lawyer‚Äô and they may re-read the entire sentence. Why?**  

By first reading "The witness examined" the reader is more likely to assume that the witness is doing the examining.
If the second sentence is read immediately after then the reader may be more likely to assume that the past pattern holds for the next sentence and may be more likely to attribute the correct structure for sentence B. Also evidence is less likely to be doing examining so the reader may be more prepared for the correct structure in this case.


7.  **Trueswell and colleagues tested this prediction and found, contrary to the predictions of the modular syntactic parser, that readers appeared to incorrectly parse A but correctly parse B (that is, readers continued on reading the sentence without appearing to pause or regress to the start of the sentence). What does this indicate about how readers make parsing decisions?**  

See above answer

8.  **What might explain the observation of patients who experience category specific deficits after some form of cortical lesion?**

Categories being things like living things and tools.
Living things have a visual components.
Tools have a use/mechanical component.
Lesion of later visual cortex results in difficulty with living things, but not tools.
Lesion of motor and pre-motor cortex results in difficulty recognizing and using tools.

# Notes from review video
Prepositional phrase attachment ambiguity
- "Shot an elephant in my pajamas" example

Focus on chapters 9-11.
Didn't get much to chapters 10-11.

Two forms of ambiguity:
1. Prepositional phrase attachment
2. Relative and reduced relative clause construction
	- Phrase follows a subject and describes the subject "The witness examined by the lawyer was unreliable"
