# **Spring 2023**
**Mission Statement**
To develop and maintain a centralized institute resource where the Georgia Tech community can receive information on voting. 

This semester we hope to create a playbook that documents how we started and maintained the institute-approved website as well as all the challenges we faced along the way. It will include the process of how we streamlined information about the voting process from registering to vote to be at the polls on Election Day. The playbook should be a guide that offers systematic approaches for other organizations to encourage voter engagement.

## Sprints
Sprint 1:

-   Creating a playbook for future reference, since the VIP is ending next semester. In order to prepare for this playbook we decided to create a rough draft in the form of google docs so that it is easy for people to add information and look at what others are thinking.

-   The feedback on our rough draft presentation was to focus on how and where to find information for the website (with the assumption that links we have now will not work when future organizations are viewing the playbook). Additional feedback was to focus on structuring our rough draft to fit into a timeline, most likely of an election year. We created and assigned a new task to specifically research timelines used in the past by the website team during an election cycle, and will spend more time on strategies to find content under our research section. We also work on adding all of our section to the shared slides that all sub teams have access to.

We hope that having an institute approved website will streamline the process of voting from registering to vote to being at the polls on Election Day as well as show the institute's commitment to engaging students in one of the most important processes in our country.

## **The Website**

---

Last semester, we created and began to populate the vote.cae.gatech.edu website. This semester, we have expanded and fine-tuned our previous work to prepare the website for the November election and subsequent runoffs.

The original voter information on the Georgia Tech website featured only a link to the Secretary of State's website. We wanted to make a one-stop shop for Georgia voters that is accessible to college-aged individuals. Through extensive research, we gathered information that clearly laid out the voting process step-by-step. 

We added several new pages to the website this semester including: Absentee Voting, Provisional Voting, the Get Involved and Get Informed pages, About VoterTech, and Tech’s Voting Policies. There was also a page with information on voting at McCamish Pavilion. The final pages we added were Election Results and Georgia Runoff Information to help students post-election. Many of our previous pages such as COVID-19 information were also updated to reflect updates about the general election. 

Visit the Website : [https://vote.cae.gatech.edu](https://vote.cae.gatech.edu/ "https://vote.cae.gatech.edu/")

        1.  Style Guide Renovation (After updated Drupal Information)
            -   Since Drupal is being updated from Version 7 to Version 9, we needed to make some adjustments to the Style Guide accordingly. Here are some of the updated screenshots:

        2.  Wireframing the new App
            -   Looking forward to next semester we wanted to create some basic pages for an app that would reflect the information found on the VoterTech website. We then created a UI mockup, translating several pages from the website to the app to see what could stay the same and what needed to be updated.
            -   Revamped the color palette to create a more modern and professional look to the app, consisting of black main pages with accent white and yellowjacket yellow to create a more professional feeling.
            -   Created a mockup of the app logo which would be used on potential user devices.

# **FALL 2021**

### Planning

-   The first two weeks of this semester were spent on planning out goals and possible projects. We gained many new members, so we were able to brainstorm many ideas.
-   All ideas are compiled in this [shared Google Sheets doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16Q4hT90jjb2ZaNMsX2QRj2rkGjloaFaJsilRBSJj15g/edit?usp=sharing "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16q4ht90jjb2zanmsx2qrj2rkgjloafajsilrbsjj15g/edit?usp=sharing"), along with the members assigned to that project and the priority of the project.
-   Our development cycle will largely follow the cycles of Spring 2021 considering that the 3-week cycle seemed to work pretty well. The first week will be spent on research and compiling information and the following two weeks will be spent on actually putting that information on the website. 
-   We plan to work on about 3 projects at a time with 2-3 members on each project. Some projects may take longer, so some adjustments might be made.
-   **Development cycle 1:**
    -   Began September 9, 2021
    -   Research collected by September 16, 2021
    -   Expected date of completion for projects is September 30, 2021
    -   Three projects being worked on:
        -   ATL election information: important information about the 2021 Atlanta election and how to vote in this election
        -   Candidate profile page (beginning with ATL candidates): information about candidates running in the current election (possible expand to current office-holders as well)
        -   Voter protection information: information on how to recognize situations where voting rights have been violated and what to do in that situation (applies for voters in all 50 states)
    -   All research docs can be found in the [shared Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tbcLGvFl7ix7-OlvWxL801-S4hUbq6Ja?usp=sharing "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tbclgvfl7ix7-olvwxl801-s4hubq6ja?usp=sharing")
-   **Development cycle 2:**
    -   Began October 7, 2021
    -   Research collected by October 18th, 2021
    -   Expected date of completion is November 2, 2021
    -   Four projects will be worked on simultaneously:
        -   Update current website: the website will be thoroughly searched for outdated information and missing/broken content such as iFrames, images, links, etc. No new page will be created for this project, but rather the goal is to make sure that all information on the website it accurate and relevant. 
        -   New webapp/website: a new website will be potentially explored that may replace or be used in conjunction to the vote.cae.gatech.edu website. Having our own domain would allow for greater flexibility and creative control. (****this project has been de-prioritized for now, but may be explored in the future**)
        -   SB 202 Information page: information on the changes that the Georgia law SB 202 enacts on voting and elections will presented on this page. The goal is to inform voters in a neutral and unbiased way about how this new law changes some of the voting processes.
        -   Expansion on voter protection page: adding an interactive map of the 50 states with relevant hotlines, information, or resources that may help protect voter rights will be added to the voter protection page
    -   Like before, all relevant documentation can be found in the [shared Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tbcLGvFl7ix7-OlvWxL801-S4hUbq6Ja?usp=sharing "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tbclgvfl7ix7-olvwxl801-s4hubq6ja?usp=sharing")
-   **Development cycle 3:**
    -   Began November 11, 2021
    -   Expected date of completion is December 7, 2021 (end of the semester)
    -   Two projects will be worked on simultaneously:
        -   Voter Protection Map: an interactive map of the 50 U.S. states that will show information pertaining to voter rights (such as accessibility information, contact information, where to report fraud, etc.) for a selected state
        -   VoterTech Style Guide: provide detailed descriptions of how to implement certain features on the GT VoterTech website. This will be used by future members of the VoterTech VIP Team and will help them when onboarding to the team.
    -   All relevant documentation can be found in the [shared Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tbcLGvFl7ix7-OlvWxL801-S4hUbq6Ja?usp=sharing "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tbclgvfl7ix7-olvwxl801-s4hubq6ja?usp=sharing")

### Gathering Information

-   About a week will be dedicated to gathering information for each project. We aim to work in the 3-week cycles as described above, so gathering information is the first week.
-   All research is compiled in shared Google Docs to make information sharing and planning more accessible and collaborative. These docs can be found the in shared Drive folder and they will also be linked below:

-   The ATL election page includes sections on what's on the ballot, information about what the responsibilities of the offices on the ballot are, how to register to vote for both in-state students and OOS who want to change their registration to Georgia, a section linking out to the mayoral candidates page made by the candidates profile page team, and more information on voting absentee and early voting.
-   **Candidates Profile Page**
    -   The goal of the candidate profile page was to inform voters about the candidates running in the Atlanta mayoral election. The candidates profile page was completed over the course of three weeks. We compiled a list of candidates and their platforms, and published the page in time for the election. The candidate information included their websites, platform, and biography. All of the information included in the page came directly from their websites to avoid any bias. A photo of the final product is attached below. [https://vote.cae.gatech.edu/atlanta-mayoral-race-2021](https://vote.cae.gatech.edu/atlanta-mayoral-race-2021 "https://vote.cae.gatech.edu/atlanta-mayoral-race-2021")

    -   The page was updated after the election to include information about the runoff candidates.
        
-   **Voter Protection Page**
-   The page wasn't totally completed (and therefore wasn't published) in the first development cycle, but it was cleaned up in the second development cycle by a different team. Furthermore the Voter Protection Resource map was worked on in the second development cycle with the goal of later adding it to the website. The following screenshots are from the final page during the second development cycle. The page can be found at: [https://vote.cae.gatech.edu/protect-your-right-vote](https://vote.cae.gatech.edu/protect-your-right-vote "https://vote.cae.gatech.edu/protect-your-right-vote")

-   **Website Update**
    -   A team was created solely to update the existing website and not create any pages. The goal of the team/project was to remove any information that had become outdated as well as to update certain visual elements to make the website look cleaner and more consistent. The Website Update tasks included the removal of outdated pages, and general corrections on pages among other things.
-   **Voter Protection Map**
-   The Voter Protection Map is meant to go hand-in-hand with the Voter Protection Page. The goal is to create an interactive map of the 50 U.S. states that show information relevant to voter rights for a selected state. Due to the fact that information, laws, and resources vary greatly from state to state, information between states will vary, but it will usually include information about accessibility, assistance, and contact information in case of any issues voting. The map has not been completed yet, but the research for each state is done and can be found in the team's [shared Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tbcLGvFl7ix7-OlvWxL801-S4hUbq6Ja?usp=sharing "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tbclgvfl7ix7-olvwxl801-s4hubq6ja?usp=sharing"). We expect for the map to be fully completed next semester.
-   Below is the map in its current, unfinished state and the research.

# **SPRING 2021**  
Planning

-   Distribution of roles and new page ideas: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QW3BoiwzF0OHnV-jdiVwnQj4eIndyPtBnJ9ZnPMEYF8/edit](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QW3BoiwzF0OHnV-jdiVwnQj4eIndyPtBnJ9ZnPMEYF8/edit "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qw3boiwzf0ohnv-jdivwnqj4eindyptbnj9znpmeyf8/edit")
-   In addition to brainstorming new ideas for pages, feedback from the student survey collected at the beginning of the semester was also taken into consideration in order to modify the webpage to better serve student needs
-   New pages were categorized into one of three priorities with the highest priority being done first in the semester and lowest priority serving as "stretch goals" if we. had time at the end of the semester
-   Overall, we came up with the following ideas for new pages:
    -   **2020 Election Reflection:** What happened in GA elections in 2020? What were major events, changes, or possible points of confusion? Ex. When Spalding Co in the General Election had countywide problems, a pipe burst in a Fulton polling location, and how results came in.
    -   **GA State Gov't 101 + Bill Tracker:** 101 on the Georgia legislature as related to voting + bill tracker of voting rights legislation in the GA general assembly
    -   **Volunteer Opportunities/Involvement:** Ways to be involved post-election Ex. Georgia Peanut Gallery, Fair Districts GA
    -   **Expansion of OOS Voting:** Better resources for OOS students to register and vote
    -   **Voting Behind the Scenes:** What's the infrastructure behind Georgia voting? The governor, sec of state, legislature, and county elections offices, poll workers, outside groups

### Gathering Information

### Final Product

-   The final pages produced during this semester are linked below. In all, several new pages were added and a few were redesigned and improved. Our original ideas evolved from what was planned, therefore there may be a few pages related to the same overarching concept. For example, the OOS voting page update, the Find Your State Legislature page, and the Ranked-Choice Voting page were all aimed to improve and expand the resources OOS have for voting.

# **FALL 2020**

### **Runoff Information**

-   Georgia's runoff election will occur on **January 5th**. Two Senate seats are on the ballot as well as some local races. Ballots will differ slightly depending on each voter's registration location.
-   According to Georgia law, if you are 18 years old by Election Day, you are allowed to register now and vote on January 5th.
-   To register, check your voter registration status, or see what's on your ballot, see your [My Voter Page](https://www.mvp.sos.ga.gov/MVP/mvp.do "https://www.mvp.sos.ga.gov/mvp/mvp.do") on the Georgia Secretary of State's website.

### **Election Results**

Current Presidential Election Projections

-   According to the Associated Press and other news sources, **Joseph R. Biden Jr.** is the new President-elect and **Kamala Harris** is the new Vice President-elect. What does this mean? These projections are based on data taken in by various news sources from numbers released by the states to the press.
-   **These results are not certified under the law.**

What about recounts?

-   As of now, several states are recounting votes or holding audits since the margin of victory for the winning candidate was very narrow. By Georgia state law, a candidate can request a recount if the margin is 1% or less. If you would like to learn more about the recount in Georgia, visit [Georgia.gov](https://georgia.gov/election-recount-rules-georgia "https://georgia.gov/election-recount-rules-georgia"). Additionally, not all states grant recounts to candidates. View the [NCSL's page on election recounts](https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/automatic-recount-thresholds.aspx "https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/automatic-recount-thresholds.aspx") to learn more about your state's specific rules around election recounts.
-   During these recounts, provisional ballots are checked for validity and any suspected errors are worked out, sometimes through a hand recount. Other issues such as voter intent or a mismatch in final totals are checked during a recount. These recounts can either be "full" or "partial" meaning either all the precincts must recount or only a select few.
-   To learn more about what happens during and after a recount, visit [Ballotpedia.](https://ballotpedia.org/How_will_election_recounts_work%3F_(2020)#What_happens_during_a_recount.3F "https://ballotpedia.org/how_will_election_recounts_work%3f_(2020)#what_happens_during_a_recount.3f")

What happens now?

-   All states must certify their elections results by **December 14th**, wherein each state's governor must prepare a Certificate of Ascertainment which contains the number of votes both the winning candidate and losing candidate(s) received.
-   On **December 14th**, the electoral votes will be cast by the electors from each state. The certificates of the electoral vote results must be brought to their respective officers by **December 23rd.** Then on **January 6th, 2021**, a joint session of Congress will be held at the Capitol where the electoral votes are counted and official elections results will be declared. Once the results are announced by a teller, any of the Members can issue a written objection to a state's returns (as long as there is one Member from the House and from the Senate). The objection will then be debated in the separate houses. Note that it is possible these dates can be pushed back if results from states are delayed.
-   **January 20th, 2021** is the presidential inauguration where the newly elected president will officially take office and begin their term.

### **Absentee Voting**

#### **Should I Vote Absentee?**

Traditionally, absentee ballots are issued to voters who request them after providing a valid reason for not voting in-person. College students may vote absentee if they are living in another state at the time of the election or are unable to return to their registered precinct for election day.

However, due to the circumstances created by COVID-19, some states are allowing voters to request absentee ballots without providing a reason. Absentee ballot circumstances vary between states with some states either automatically sending **absentee ballots** or **requests** for absentee ballots to all eligible voters for the upcoming election ([usa.gov](https://www.usa.gov/absentee-voting "https://www.usa.gov/absentee-voting")). If you are unfamiliar with your state's rules regarding absentee ballots this election, please visit the [NASS's Absentee and Early Voting page](https://www.nass.org/can-i-vote/absentee-early-voting "https://www.nass.org/can-i-vote/absentee-early-voting") and select your state to see their protocols. 

Once you have determined you are eligible to vote absentee, follow the steps below to learn how to request, fill out, mail-in, and check on your absentee ballot.

#### ****Step 1: Requesting an absentee ballot****

-   Important Distinctions 
    -   You **must be registered to vote** in order to request an absentee ballot. Check your registration status [here](https://www.nass.org/can-I-vote/voter-registration-status "https://www.nass.org/can-i-vote/voter-registration-status").
    -   Some states are **automatically mailing absentee ballot applications** to all eligible voters while some other states are **directly mailing absentee ballots** **without having voters fill out an application**. If your state is not doing either of the aforementioned processes and you would like to vote absentee, you must fill out a **request** for an absentee ballot and submit it correctly in order to receive your absentee ballot.
    -   Typically, **you must request an absentee ballot again for each new election.** For example, if you requested an absentee ballot for the primary election, you must request an absentee ballot again for the general election if you wish to vote absentee again. However, there are a few states that have an option to automatically receive absentee ballots for all eligible elections in a calendar year. Check your state's elections page to see if this applies to you.

-   Find Your State 
    -   Visit the [NASS's Absentee and Early Voting page](https://www.nass.org/can-i-vote/absentee-early-voting "https://www.nass.org/can-i-vote/absentee-early-voting") and select your state from the drop-down menu. From there, you will be directed to your state's official absentee ballot page that will contain your state's application for an absentee ballot.
    -   Some states may allow you to fill out and submit the application online while others may require you to print the application and mail it. Be sure to check your state's acceptable methods for submitting an absentee ballot application.
    -   **It is recommended that you request an absentee ballot at least 90 days before the election you wish to vote in**. ([fvap.gov](https://www.nass.org/can-i-vote/absentee-early-voting "https://www.nass.org/can-i-vote/absentee-early-voting"))
    -   Check Vote.org's [Absentee Ballot Application Deadlines](https://www.vote.org/absentee-ballot-deadlines/ "https://www.vote.org/absentee-ballot-deadlines/") to see every state's deadlines to submit an application for an absentee ballot.

#### **Step 2: Filling out your absentee ballot[[edit](https://wiki.vip.gatech.edu/mediawiki/index.php?title=Voting_Information_Guide_Team&veaction=edit&vesection=15 "https://wiki.vip.gatech.edu/mediawiki/index.php?title=voting_information_guide_team&veaction=edit&vesection=15") | [edit source](https://wiki.vip.gatech.edu/mediawiki/index.php?title=Voting_Information_Guide_Team&action=edit&section=15 "https://wiki.vip.gatech.edu/mediawiki/index.php?title=voting_information_guide_team&action=edit&section=15")]**

-   My absentee ballot came!
    -   You submitted your application for an absentee ballot and now you have received your official absentee ballot in the mail. Great!
    -   **Be sure to follow all instructions enclosed with your absentee ballot.** State's rules can vary, be sure to adhere to the directions provided with **your** absentee ballot to avoid the rejection of your ballot.
    -   Check to make sure you are filling out the application with an acceptable writing utensil.
    -   Double-check your ballot! Make sure you have marked a candidate for every position you wish to vote for.

-   My absentee ballot has not arrived... 
    -   You may be able to check the ballot issue date for your absentee ballot on your state's election page. If you live in Georgia, you can visit your [My Voter Page](https://www.mvp.sos.ga.gov/MVP/mvp.do "https://www.mvp.sos.ga.gov/mvp/mvp.do") to see the issue date of your absentee ballot.
    -   Most states do not print and mail absentee ballots **more than 30 days before** the election, so if you applied early, you may have to wait. However, if you still have not received your absentee ballot and the election is **less than two weeks away**, call your local election official.

#### **Step 3: Submitting your absentee ballot**

-   I have finished filling out my ballot!
    -   Now it's time to submit your absentee ballot and effectively cast your vote for the election.
    -   State's rules on submitting absentee ballots vary. Most states allow you to mail back in your absentee ballot but some states offer local ballot drop-boxes, faxing, and online submissions of absentee ballots.
    -   **Check your state's official absentee ballot guidelines to see the acceptable methods for submitting your absentee ballot**.
    -   [Click here to see each state's deadline for receiving an absentee ballot.](https://www.vote.org/absentee-ballot-deadlines/ "https://www.vote.org/absentee-ballot-deadlines/")

-   I no longer wish to submit my ballot...
    -   If you have changed your mind and decide you would like to vote in-person on election day you have a few options.
    -   If you received your absentee ballot in the mail, bring it with you to your polling place. A poll official will spoil the ballot and allow you to cast an in-person vote.
    -   If you do not bring the absentee ballot with you or were marked as having been issued an absentee ballot but never received it, you may have to vote provisionally at your polling place.

#### **Step 4: Checking on your absentee ballot**

-   I am a Georgia voter
    -   If you are registered to vote in the state of Georgia, you can check your absentee ballot status on your [Georgia My Voter Page.](https://www.mvp.sos.ga.gov/MVP/mvp.do "https://www.mvp.sos.ga.gov/mvp/mvp.do")
    -   Enter your first initial, last name, county, and date of birth in the right-hand login section and click submit.
    -   From there, you will see a box labeled "Absentee Ballot Request Information". In that box, click "Click here for Absentee Ballot status" and you will be provided with the date your ballot was sent to you, as well as the date it was received or if it was rejected.
    -   If you have any concerns about your absentee ballot status contact your county registrar. [Click here to find your county registrar.](https://elections.sos.ga.gov/Elections/countyregistrars.do "https://elections.sos.ga.gov/elections/countyregistrars.do")

-   I am an OOS voter
    -   Navigate to your state's official absentee voting page by selecting your state from the drop-down menu on the [NASS's Absentee and Early Voting](https://www.nass.org/can-i-vote/absentee-early-voting "https://www.nass.org/can-i-vote/absentee-early-voting") page . If your state offers a way of checking your absentee ballot status, it will be mentioned on their absentee voting page. Most states have a way for voters to check their absentee ballot status online, while there are some states or parts of states that have alternative methods of confirming your ballot was received, such as by calling your local elections office.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: Are absentee ballots the same as mail-in ballots?**

A: Some states use the term "mail-in" ballot interchangeably with "absentee" ballot. However, there are several states that conduct mail-in only elections, and voters that are out of the state for Election Day might request an absentee ballot. In this case, absentee ballots are a form of mail-in ballots.

**Q: How do I know if my vote has been counted?**

A: Some states, such as Georgia, have a website you can visit to check if your absentee ballot was received and confirm that it was not rejected. If you have any concerns about the status of your ballot, contact your state's elections officials.

**Q: What happens if I make a mistake while filling out my absentee ballot?**

A: Your ballot will come enclosed with instructions that detail how to spoil your ballot if you made a mistake. In the event you have to start over, there will be instructions on how to request a new absentee ballot.

**Q: When can I apply for an absentee ballot and when is the deadline?**

A: Voters can request an absentee ballot up to 180 days before an election. [Click here to view the deadlines for this year's absentee ballot](https://www.vote.org/absentee-ballot-deadlines/ "https://www.vote.org/absentee-ballot-deadlines/").

**Q: If I lose the absentee ballot that was sent to me, can I get another one?**

A: You can, but you must first sign an affidavit affirming that you lost, destroyed, or did not receive the first absentee ballot. In this case, another ballot will be issued to you.

**Q: If I requested an absentee ballot, can I change my mind and still vote at my polling place?**

A:

-   If the ballot has been completed and returned and received by your elections office, you **cannot** vote at your regular polling place.
-   If you still have the absentee ballot and give it to the poll manager at your polling place, you may receive a regular ballot.
-   If you have not received an absentee ballot and want to early vote in person or vote in person on election day, you can still vote in person. Tell a poll worker that you have not received your absentee ballot yet. You will have to sign an affidavit and then you can vote.
-   If you have returned the absentee ballot, you generally cannot vote in person. Please contact your county elections office for more information about your specific situation.

**Q: Can I give my voted absentee ballot to someone else to return to the elections office?**

A: Only physically disabled voters can do this. A physically disabled voter can designate a relative or an individual residing in the same household to return his or her voted ballot in person or by mail to the elections office.

### **Provisional Voting**

#### **What is a Provisional Ballot?**

-   Provisional ballots are a back-up measure put in place to ensure that no individual is unable to vote due to an administrative error. The ballot is the same as a normal ballot one would receive if voting normally, however, it is set aside from regular ballots to be reviewed later.

#### **Why did I have to cast a Provisional Ballot?**

-   There are several reasons a person might have to cast a provisional ballot:
    -   Eligibility to vote cannot be established
    -   Registration information does not match the identification presented
    -   No identification or unacceptable identification is presented
    -   Name does not show up on poll or registration list
    -   An absentee ballot was shown to be received but the voter claims they did not mail it
    -   Citizenship is contested

#### **What do I do now?**

-   Don't worry, you can still make sure your vote is counted!
-   First, understand why you were not allowed to vote on the polling machines. A poll worker will let you know the reason.
-   If you were unable to present a valid form of identification, this is typically fixed by going to your local elections office and providing the correct photo I.D.
    -   Other issues can also be solved this way; by going to your local elections office and changing information or providing missing information.
-   Also note, in most states, in order for your ballot to be counted, the issue must be resolved within three days of Election Day (typically by the end of business hours on that Friday).
-   Some states also allow you to check your provisional ballot status online! See your state's elections website [here](https://www.usa.gov/election-office "https://www.usa.gov/election-office") to find out if this is an option for you.

#### **Will my vote be counted?**

-   Unfortunately, with provisional ballots, there is a chance your vote will not get counted if the issued that caused you to vote provisionally has not been resolved soon after Election Day.
-   To ensure your vote gets counted, be sure to follow some of the guidelines above, or ask a poll worker how to resolve the issue so you can ensure your vote is counted!
-   If you voted in the wrong precinct, chances are only parts of your ballot will be counted. If you voted on a candidate who was not also on the ballot in your precinct, your vote will not count for that individual. However, any other races you were eligible to vote in will be counted.

We recognize the natural rights of life, liberty, and property set forth by our Founding Fathers. Our country was created to protect the freedoms of the individual and be directed by We the People. We recognize that freedom requires responsibility, and therefore we hold ourselves to a high standard of character and conduct. Integrity motivates our action. Principle defines our outlook towards government. Peace and prosperity drive our ambitions towards our countrymen. We inherit a corrupt, coercive world that has lost respect for voluntary action. Our government has failed and dragged our country into moral decay. The political class dominates the agenda with a violent, callous, controlling grip. For this we do not stand. We welcome limited government conservatives, classical liberals, and libertarians who trust in the creed we set forth. WE, as Young Americans for Liberty believe: that government is the negation of liberty; that voluntary action is the only ethical behavior; that respect for the individual's property is fundamental to a peaceful society; that violent action is only warranted in defense of one's property; that the individual owns his/her body and is therefore responsible for his/her actions; that society is a responsibility of the people, not the government.

### **Become a Poll Worker**

Poll workers are essential to ensuring that an election is run smoothly. Having more poll workers at a polling place helps to avoid long lines, machine errors, and other hiccups that may inadvertently disenfranchise voters. Becoming a poll worker is a good way to not only be an active participant in our nation's democracy, but you can also get paid for it, making it an ideal job for college students looking to make some quick, extra money. Additionally, you might be able to forgo compensation and receive volunteer hours instead. Though poll work varies by local election offices, the general responsibilities for a poll worker are as follows:

-   Before election day, make sure to vote as you might not have the chance to do so when you're working
-   Attend all mandatory training sessions as required by your county
-   Prepare the polling place by setting up voting machines and/or other required equipment
-   Arrive early in the morning (around 6:00am) and commit to working the whole day until polls close (about 7:00pm)

For **Georgia,** in order to be eligible to work as a poll worker, you must:

-   Be at least 16 years of age
-   Be a resident or employee of the county in which you want to work
-   Be able to read, write, and speak English

To apply as a poll worker, find your local election office which should contain more specific information and the application to apply.
