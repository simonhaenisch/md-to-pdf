Texting rushees isn't as easy as you might think. There's a lot of nuance that goes into the perfect text. Since we heavily rely on the texting list to get rushees to event you really want to make sure that you've got this part down solid. Here some good tips

### How to Make a Text
- Short, but informative
	- Ideally your opening text should be along the lines of 3-5 sentences. Any more and it turns into a short story. Any less and it gets really vague with no detail.
- ALWAYS end with a question
	- This is the biggest thing that I've learned. The human psyche wants to respond to people's questions. If you end your text with a statement. it is WAY easier to just ignore it. Ending with a call to action question makes them at least 50% more likely to respond. 
	- Example
		- When do you move onto campus?
		- When is your CWE time?
		- Do you think you'll be able to make it to XYZ event this friday?
			- It's much better to ask if they can make it a single event versus asking if they can make it to any event you have on the schedule
- Keep the tone light and casual
	- Try to make it sound like you're already their buddy and youre trying to invite them to the cookout. You don't want to make it sound TOO formal, but also don't be super super casual. Avoid exclamation marks too. 
- Be specific
	- Don't say "are you interested in rush?"
		- Of course they're interested in rush, that's the only reason you have their phone number
	- When you text them, tell them about the details of the events coming up
		- This weekend we're having a cookout at the house with the brothers who are in Auburn over the Summer
		- Next weekend we are gonna have a poker night at the house with a $10 buy-in
