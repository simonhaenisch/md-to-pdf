## Rushees Friends

# !! IF YOU DON'T DO ANYTHING ELSE ON THIS LIST AT LEAST DO THIS !! 

One of the best and most underrated ways to get more rushees is telling PNMs and acceptees that they can bring friends to events. Going to Rush events is scary. You don't know anyone at the event. You don't know anything about how fraternities work. Being able to bring a friend makes it a lot less intimidating. Rushees want to bring their friends, but they think they can't since they weren't explicitly invited.

Make sure when you invite rushees to events add to the end of your text "let me know if any of your friends wants to come as well". This lets them know its okay to bring mutiple people. This effectively just increased the amount of rushees at your event by 40% with little to no effort. I didn't really do this my first year as rush chair and I regret it.

## Other Rush Chairs

Do your best to be social with the other rush chairs in Auburn. The past two AGR rush chairs have both sent me really good rushees. If you have a rushee who wants to check out other frats, refer them to another rush chair. This is a great way to form good connections and is ultimately mutually beneficial. Other rush chairs are the only ones who actually understand all the stress you're going through, and you can bond over that. 

## Instagram 

Follow every Freshman Class of 202X account you can find on IG. Then DM every male in their followers list. The response rate to cold DMs is surprisingly good. Most people on IG arent registered for rush, so you are the first person to ever talk to them about it. Rushees signed up for recruitment have 25+ frats texting them, they're not going to respond to all the guys texting their numbers. They're more likely to respond to personalized DMs 

## Texting List

This is the main way that we get rushees. Relying on this list is bad though. Every person on this list is being texted by a million different frats. They have no reason to give you any attention at all. 

There is as lot a nuance that comes with texting the list, and so I have made a seperate document with more details on just that.

## On Campus activities

One method that we have never tried is helping rushees move into their dorms. Make sure to write down on your calendar when dorm move in is. You will get so overwhelmed with Fall Rush that you will forget when this date is, and then you will forget it when the time comes. 

Before Spring Rush you should try to have at least 1 on campus charity event. This gives you a way to talk to people on campus about joining your event. Try to do a Pie a Sig or Plant a Flag event at least. 

## To Better the Man Scholarship

The TBTM scholarship is a really good program and I highly highly reccomend that you do it. The types of people that apply are highly motivated and smart rushees. You want these types of people as pledges. Making them go through an interview also gives you an opportunity to have a 1 on 1 conversation with them. 

## Referrals 

This is historically the part of recruitment that we are lacking on the most. Rushees that you get from a referral from someone you know are WAY WAY more likely to join. This is how big frats get 80% of their pledges. 

You need to really stress to brothers the emphasis of getting referrals. Tell them to invite their friends out to events even if they're not rushing. Worst case scenario nothing changes and they don't join. Best case scenario, they join the fraternity or they tell their friends who ARE rushing about us.

You should tell every person in the chapter to text every sorority girl they know 1 month before school starts to ask if they know anyone that's rushing. Make sure people are actually texting girls and not just ignoring your texts. 

You should also be placing heavy emphasis on the past 2 pledge classes on bringing in rushees. These NIBS are the youngest and therefore are the most likely to know ruhsees. You can't reasonably expect your Seniors to know many rushees. Make the NIBS have a list of 5+ people that might be interested in rush.
