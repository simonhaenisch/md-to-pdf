## What events should I plan?

The goal for a rush event is to have something that attracts rushee interest, and allows for rushees to get to know brothers in a close setting. The best rush events are the ones where PNMs have an excuse to be doing something that doesn't take a lot of attention and then can talk to brothers primarily. A crawfish boil is a great example of this. The main thing you are doing at a crawfish boil is talking to brothers, but during the gaps in the conversation you can peel shrimp by yourself. 

You don't want to plan events where there is limited conversation opportunities and rushees get isolated from brothers. I personally am not a big fan of Atlanta Braves games or other sports events for rush events. Sitting in stadium seats means that you can only talk to the two adjacent people to you. You can't really move around and meet new people, which defeats the purpose of the event. On top of this, taking 20 guys to sporting events is really expensive.
