## General

You want rushees to feel like they're special. They're not, but you want to make them feel like they are. Your conversations with rushees should be oriented to make THEM the focus, not you. 

Ideally, you should be talking about yourself as little as possible. Be interested, not interesting. 

## Topics

- What made you want to choose your major?
- Where are you from?
	- What do you miss about your hometown?
		- *If their hometown sucks
			- What do you like more about Auburn?
	- *If they are from far away
		- What made you want to come to Auburn then?
- What major are you?
	- What made you want to choose that major?
	- What you got you interested in X topic?
	- *If Pro-Flight*
		- How many flight hours do you have right now?
		- When is your flight block?
* Fraternity
	- What made you want to join a fraternity?
	- What are you looking for in a fraternity?
	- Do you have any questions about how fraternities work?
	- How many houses have you been able to visit so far?
		- I don't reccomend brothers talk about other fraternities, but it's okay if you do it as the rush chair
		- Asking this question is a good way for you to get a feel for how experienced they are with rush and what type of frat they're looking for
			- If they say they've been to Snu, ATO, etc then its good to talk about how we're different from those other organizations

## Topics to AVOID

- Drugs
- Pledgeship
	- When rushees ask, tell them that it is challenging, but it is very rewarding
	- Keep it real with them
		- If you bullshit about what pledgeship is, they will know
		- I normally say "Im gonna keep it real with you. You don't need to be worried about pledgeship here. The goal that we have for pledgeship is to make you a better brother. The goal is not to throw you in a basement and see how fast you can drink a handle of fireball"
